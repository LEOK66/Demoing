This project involves building a web application that allows users to upload audio tracks, apply various audio effects such as equalization, reverb, and compression, and then export the processed tracks. The application consists of a front-end interface for user interaction and a back-end server for handling audio processing and file management.![image](https://github.com/LEOK66/Demoing/assets/155023646/8a8a9421-d9ad-4d52-9fb0-4081382f08b5)
